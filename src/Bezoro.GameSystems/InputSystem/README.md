# InputSystem

External input ingestion for ECS movement, with hold-last behavior and sequence-based ordering.

## Types

| Type                     | Description                                                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IInputCommandSink`      | External producer contract for enqueueing immutable `InputCommand` values. |
| `InputCommand`           | Immutable movement command (`ControlId`, axis values, `Sequence`).         |
| `InputCommandQueue`      | Thread-safe ingress with world-thread latest-per-control snapshots.                  |
| `InputControl`           | Component that maps an entity to a logical input channel id.               |
| `MovementIntent`         | Component storing currently applied movement intent.                       |
| `MovementInputSettings`  | Component with per-entity movement speed and hold duration.                |
| `InputIngestionSystem`   | `FixedTick` + `Input` stage system that drains queued commands.            |
| `IntentToVelocitySystem` | `FixedTick` + `PreTick` stage system that converts intent to `Velocity`.   |
| `InputWorldExtensions`   | Convenience methods for queue resource setup and pipeline registration.    |

## Quick start

```csharp
using Bezoro.ECS.Services;
using Bezoro.ECS.Types;
using Bezoro.GameSystems.InputSystem.Extensions;
using Bezoro.GameSystems.InputSystem.Types;
using Bezoro.GameSystems.MovementSystem.Services;
using Bezoro.GameSystems.MovementSystem.Types;

using var world = new World();
world.AddMovementInputPipeline();
world.AddSystem(new MovementSystem(), Stage.Tick);

var queue = world.GetOrCreateInputCommandQueue();

var player = world.Spawn(
    new Position(),
    new Velocity(),
    new InputControl { ControlId = 1 },
    new MovementIntent()
);
world.Add(player, new MovementInputSettings { Speed = 5f, HoldDurationSeconds = 0.15f });

queue.Enqueue(new InputCommand(controlId: 1, moveX: 1f, moveY: 0f, moveZ: 0f, sequence: 1));
world.FixedTick(0.02f);
```

## API reference

### InputCommandQueue

| Member                                         | Description                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Enqueue(in InputCommand)`                     | Adds an external command from any thread.                    |
| `Enqueue(int,float,float,float,ulong)`         | Convenience overload for command creation + enqueue.         |
| `SimulationTimeSeconds`                        | Float view of accumulated simulation time; aging uses an internal double timestamp.            |

### InputWorldExtensions

| Method                                | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GetOrCreateInputCommandQueue(World)` | Returns existing input queue resource or creates one.        |
| `AddMovementInputPipeline(World)`     | Registers ingestion and intent systems with correct stages.  |

## Hold-last behavior

- Each control id keeps the highest accepted `Sequence`. Equal or lower sequences are ignored and do not refresh the command's age. Sequence zero is valid for the first command; sequence wraparound is not implemented.
- A command is timestamped when ingestion drains it, not when a producer enqueues it. Time spent in the producer queue is not included in its hold age.
- `IntentToVelocitySystem` keeps that command active while command age is less than or equal to `HoldDurationSeconds`. A zero hold applies during its ingestion update only when simulation time advances between updates.
- When the hold window expires without newer input, `MovementIntent` and `Velocity` are zeroed.

## Runtime notes

- Producers and consumers are isolated: external threads only enqueue immutable commands.
- Queue inspection, time advancement, snapshot consumption, ECS writes, and world disposal belong to the world update thread. Only `Enqueue` is a producer-thread operation.
- Ingress and the latest-per-control map have no capacity or expiration cleanup policy. Reuse a bounded set of control IDs and control producer backlog at the application boundary.
- Commands reject negative control IDs and non-finite axes. Invalid mutable movement settings or velocity multiplication overflow neutralize that entity's complete intent and velocity vector; other entities continue updating.
- Timestamps use double precision internally, avoiding float-resolution loss that can otherwise keep short inputs held after long runtimes. `SimulationTimeSeconds` remains a float compatibility/display view.
- `World.FixedTick` rejects non-finite or negative deltas. Direct calls to `InputIngestionSystem.Update` skip time advancement for those values.
- Input sequence numbers order commands for one control. They do not make the whole simulation deterministic across different producer timing or platforms.
- Stage ordering is explicit: input ingestion (`Input`) -> velocity conversion (`PreTick`) -> movement (`Tick`).

## Validation

```bash
dotnet test tests/Bezoro.GameSystems.Tests/Bezoro.GameSystems.Tests.csproj -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "FullyQualifiedName~InputSystem"
```

These tests cover hold-window boundaries, stale sequences, numeric recovery, and expiry after long simulated uptime. See [the module README](../README.md) for targets and engine integration.
