# Bezoro.GameSystems

ECS-native gameplay systems built on top of `Bezoro.ECS`, `Bezoro.Core`, and `Bezoro.Events`. The assembly groups reusable runtime pipelines that can be composed into game loops without coupling them to any specific engine.

## Included systems

- `ActivationSystem`: deferred callback activation with priority ordering and per-tick budget control
- `HealthSystem`: health state, damage, healing, and lifecycle-oriented health flow
- `InputSystem`: input command ingestion patterns for ECS-driven gameplay
- `StreamingSystem`: streaming-oriented system composition for chunk or world activation workflows
- `TimerSystem`: timer components and tick-based timer progression

## Quick start

```csharp
using Bezoro.ECS.Services;
using Bezoro.GameSystems.ActivationSystem.Extensions;
using Bezoro.GameSystems.ActivationSystem.Types;

using var world = new World();
world.SetResource(new ActivationConfig(maxActivationsPerTick: 4));
world.AddActivationPipeline();
```

## API reference

| Area | Primary APIs |
| --- | --- |
| Activation | `ActivationWorldExtensions`, `ActivationConfig`, `ActivationCommandQueue`, `ActivationHandle` |
| Health | `HealthWorldExtensions`, `Health`, `HealthMutationRequest`, `HealthChangedEvent` |
| Input | `InputWorldExtensions`, `InputCommandQueue`, `InputControl`, `MovementIntent` |
| Movement | `MovementSystem`, `Position`, `Velocity` |
| Streaming | `StreamingSystem`, `StreamingConfig`, `StreamState`, `StreamingStateChangedEvent` |
| Timer | `TimerWorldExtensions`, `Timer`, `TimerMode`, `TimerLifecycleEvent` |

## Runtime behavior

- Pipelines register ECS systems and resources through explicit `World` extension methods.
- Only ingress queues explicitly documented as thread-safe accept producer-thread calls. World APIs, resource access, and health/timer helpers run on the world update thread.
- Lifecycle events are stored in world resources so consumers can drain them during their own systems.
- World updates require finite, non-negative delta times. Unity hosts typically call `Tick(Time.deltaTime)` in `Update` and `FixedTick(Time.fixedDeltaTime)` in `FixedUpdate`; Godot hosts can call them from their corresponding process callbacks.
- Callbacks run on the world update thread unless the subsystem has an explicitly configured dispatcher. The framework does not move the complete simulation to the engine's main thread.
- Drain lifecycle queues regularly. A processing budget limits work per update and does not by itself bound producer backlog or memory use.
- Input timestamps use double precision internally so short hold windows still expire after long uptimes. The existing public float timestamp is for display and compatibility.
- Timer construction rejects non-finite values. The timer system skips advancement for non-finite values introduced through mutable timer fields, allowing recovery after those fields are repaired.

- [Bezoro.Events](../Bezoro.Events/README.md)

## Design notes

- Systems depend only on Bezoro framework contracts and remain independent of Unity or another engine.
- Mutable gameplay data is represented as ECS components or resources rather than hidden service state.
- Ingestion, processing, and dispatch are separate systems when a workflow crosses a queue boundary.
- Generated query specifications keep filtering and scheduler metadata compile-time visible.

## Targets and validation

Targets .NET 10 and .NET Standard 2.1. Unity 6 consumes the precompiled .NET Standard assembly; see the [Unity package](../../unity-package/README.md) for installation. The systems do not depend on Unity or Godot types.

Use the SDK selected by [global.json](../../global.json):

```bash
dotnet build src/Bezoro.GameSystems/Bezoro.GameSystems.csproj -c Release
dotnet test tests/Bezoro.GameSystems.Tests/Bezoro.GameSystems.Tests.csproj -c Release -f net10.0
```

The tests exercise ECS composition and numeric behavior without launching an engine. They do not establish platform-specific frame budgets or AOT compatibility; validate those in the target player build.
