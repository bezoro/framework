# Composable NPC behaviors

```sh
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/Bezoro.Behaviors.ConsoleDemo
```

The example runs a tree that owns a statechart. Patrolling owns a memory tree that continues walking without reevaluating its successful prefix. At 500 ms, a scheduled perception signal changes the mode to Combat and aborts the walking activation once. Combat owns a tree containing a flat aiming state machine, which itself owns a tree action. Another compiled subtree performs the attack. A completion signal finishes the mode and propagates success through the graph.

The nesting is BT -> statechart -> BT -> flat FSM -> BT, plus a native BT subtree. One visit budget is forwarded by reference across the graph. The C# 9 consumer additionally checks progress with one visit per update. Runtime children are configured once and owned by one occurrence; immutable definitions can be shared by other actors with their own runtimes.

Perception is scheduled separately from behavior execution. Only the signal invokes the vision predicate. Mutable runtime access is serialized by this host; engine physics, scene access and perception queries belong to application adapters. Setup allocations and application instrumentation are not included in the libraries' steady-state allocation claims.
