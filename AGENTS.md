## Package Version Source

Context: Unity package staging and CI release builds.
Rule: Resolve package versions with `scripts/Get-PackageVersion.ps1` from SemVer Git tags; use `BEZORO_PACKAGE_VERSION` or `-PackageVersion` only for explicit local overrides.
Reason: `unity-package/package.json`, release assembly metadata, and CI publishing should stay on one version source.

## Public API readability

Context: All public APIs throughout the framework.

Apply this standard when adding new APIs and when reviewing or redesigning existing APIs across the entire codebase. It is the guiding criterion for the future framework-wide API rework.

Rules:

- Make public APIs as intuitive as possible for human readers. Usage should be clear, declarative, and follow a natural logical sequence, almost like reading a book.
- Choose names, parameters, and composition patterns that express the caller's intent. Avoid cryptic abbreviations, unexplained positional values, and surprising behavior.
- Make ownership, lifecycle, side effects, and failure behavior clear in the public contract. Keep implementation and storage details internal whenever callers do not need them.
- Internal implementations may be complex when that complexity materially improves performance or memory use. Keep that complexity behind the API and document the invariants needed to maintain it.
- Preserve the pay-for-use principle. A readable API must not introduce unnecessary allocations, processing, or mandatory abstractions.

Reason: Consumers should be able to understand what their code does by reading its public API calls, even when the implementation uses advanced optimizations.
