# Bezoro.Core.Tests

Unit tests for `Bezoro.Core` primitives, extensions, helpers, and utility types.

## Types

| Type/Area           | Description                                                                                                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Helpers/*Tests`    | Mirrors `src/Bezoro.Core/Helpers` (converter, array, comparers, exception, and validation helper behavior).           |
| `Types/*Tests`      | Mirrors `src/Bezoro.Core/Types` (grid, result, singleton, try helpers, percent, ranges, vectors, pools, collections). |
| `Utilities/*Tests`  | Mirrors `src/Bezoro.Core/Utilities` (`StringTags` processing and replacement behavior).                               |
| `Extensions/*Tests` | Mirrors `src/Bezoro.Core/Extensions` (arrays, collections, enums, spans, memory, strings, and type extensions).       |

## Run

```bash
dotnet test tests/Bezoro.Core.Tests/Bezoro.Core.Tests.csproj -c Release -f net10.0 --verbosity minimal
```

## Coverage notes

- Tests are deterministic and focus on behavior contracts and edge cases.
- High-churn suites are split into focused files (`Types/Try*Tests`, `Extensions/StringExtensions*Tests`) for maintainability.
- Assertions use xUnit and FluentAssertions.
- Pool tests protect the owned-capacity invariant: failed creation reservations are released, and owned items rejected
  during rent validation or return reset are removed and discarded exactly once.
- `PooledObjectHandle<T>` tests cover copied handles to ensure that all struct copies share disposal state and return their
  value exactly once.
- `SwapbackArray<T>` lookup tests exercise `TryGetIndex(T, out uint)` as the canonical lookup kernel; the legacy nullable
  index helper remains covered for compatibility.
- Compatibility tests preserve obsolete expression guards, lifecycle boolean overloads, and formatting convenience shims
  while guiding callers to the canonical APIs.

## Conventions

- Test method names follow `Method_WhenCondition_ShouldExpectation`.
- Each test class targets a focused source type or behavior slice.
- Disposable resources in tests use explicit ownership/disposal patterns.

Tests use the .NET 10 SDK selected by [global.json](../../global.json). They run without Unity or Godot and do not replace validation in engine player builds.

## Regression coverage

- `GridSafetyTests` covers dimension overflow, invalid span dimensions and storage, row-aliasing coordinates, pooled initialization, and access after disposal.
- `SwapbackArraySafetyTests` covers replacement at the logical end, self-appending, partial enumeration failures, and indirectly aliased LINQ sources. Capacity-boundary tests exercise arithmetic without allocating multi-gigabyte arrays.
- `ObjectPoolLifecycleSafetyTests` covers disposal with pending timed and indefinite renters, infinite timeouts, duplicate owned returns, reset and validation failures, failed prewarming, and continuing cleanup after a discard failure.
- `ObjectPoolDuplicateOwnershipTests` covers foreign-object ownership, preserving active rentals when the pool is full, and duplicate returns during reset or discard and after disposal.
- Validation-helper tests require valid objects to pass the obsolete null guard and preserve named parameter details for null values.

Concurrency tests use bounded waits to expose ownership errors. Passing them is evidence for those scenarios, not a proof covering every possible thread interleaving.
