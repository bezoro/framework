# Bezoro.Persistence.Tests

Tests for the engine-independent save envelope and file-store contracts. CRC vectors use IEEE CRC-32 reference values; the binary envelope fixture was generated independently with Python `struct` and `zlib`.

Filesystem tests use their own temporary directories and remove them after awaiting all operations. A controlled `MemoryManager<byte>` introduces cancellation or failure after checksumming, during payload I/O, without sleeps. Concurrency tests verify that readers see checksum-valid whole saves while one or multiple store instances replace a slot. A controlled path-gate hold verifies that queued snapshot reads and deletes cancel without releasing another operation's gate, modifying the destination buffer, or removing the save.

The delete-snapshot regression keeps an actual file handle open, removes and recreates its live slot, verifies the new save, then validates the original envelope through the old handle. After closing that handle, no temporary tombstone may remain. This exercises Windows delete-pending behavior without timing sleeps.

These tests run against .NET on the host filesystem. They do not validate a Unity player, IL2CPP, Godot export, browser storage, or a console save API. See the [module contracts and format](../../src/Bezoro.Persistence/README.md).
